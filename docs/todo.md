## SOFTWARE TODO

#### last updated 22 aug 18

- [ ] add visual feedback (use amimationCombinator w/ strobe)
- [ ] buffer rapid presses?
- [ ] debug flag that enables the above and sets `NUMLEDS` to ~10 (trade leds for serial print strings in memory)
- [ ] save memory by casting `long`s to something else (`uint_16`?) i.e. in Knob.h
- [x] Ensure radio is muted for first second or so of operation. This will ensure that a newly booted radio doesn't alter the group's animation sequence.
- [x] Ensure that non-matching packet secrets ignore packet.
- [x] `config.h` `KNOB_DEBUG` & `RADIO_DEBUG` enable/disable serial print lines
- [x] add `ifdefs` to `config.h` to set options for ws2811, ws2815, sk9822
- [x] lowpower mode triggered by 3000 ms long press
- [x] swap order of cmdMode pattern from short-med to med-short
- [x] wrap press duration logic in descriptive variables

## PCB TODO

#### last updated 22 aug 18

- [ ] switch 6/7 labels on silkscreen
- [ ] switch clock & data on silkscreen
- [ ] move position of version label on silkscreen so visible after wires added
- [ ] increase inside diameter of power holes, radio holes
- [ ] add holes to the corners, esp opposite radio end; use ziptie thru holes to secure cables
- [ ] switch radio pins layout from 1x7 to 2x8 compatibile with female ribbon cable header (we'll just solder 2 rows of 1x4 header pins to those holes then push the ribbon cable on)
